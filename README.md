# Freedomland
*A Window to the Future of Ethereum as a Free Economic Territory*

&nbsp;


# Introduction


Blockchain is a new type of territory, a new freedomland.

When we discover such a new land, gold rush is one of the first predictable events that take place.

When California gold rush started at 1848, the non-Indian population of California was about 8,000. But just after 4 years, gold rush brought up over 200,000 people to there. The first age of California population came there just looking for gold. But it was just the first step in shaping a state with 40,000,000 population now.

Current cryptocurrenices are gold of this new territory we have just discovered. Base population who came to this new territory are here looking for gold. Finding gold in a new territory has an enormous effect on making a powerful base of its development, but it is just a base, a first step. To make an economy, we need much more, we need money! Just take a look at $6 trillion worldwide gold market size, and compare it with $90 trillion money market size to understand what it means.

As Hayek stated, gold can not be a good money although it is the best start to make money free from governments:

> I do believe that if today all the legal obstacles were removed which prevent such an issue of private money under distinct names, in the first instance indeed, as all of you would expect, people would from their own experience be led to rush for the only thing they know and understand, and start using gold.

> But this very fact would after a while make it very doubtful whether gold was for the purpose of money really a good standard. It would turn out to be a very good investment, for the reason that because of the increased demand for gold the value of gold would go up; But that very fact would make it very unsuitable as money. You do not want to incur debts in terms of a unit which constantly goes up in value as it would in this case, so people would begin to look for another kind of money: if they were free to choose the money, in terms of which they kept their books, made their calculations, incurred debts or lent money, they would prefer a standard which remains stable in purchasing power. ...

> If such a money were issued by some reputable institution, the public would probably first choose different definitions of the standard to be adopted, different kinds of index numbers of price in terms of which it is measured; but the process of competition would gradually teach both the issuing banks and the public which kind of money would be the most advantageous.

> The interesting fact is that what I have called the monopoly of government of issuing money has not only deprived us of good money but has also deprived us of the only process by which we can find out what would be good money. We do not even quite know what exact qualities we want because in the two thousand years in which we have used coins and other money, we have never been allowed to experiment with it, we have never been given a chance to find out what the best kind of money would be.

Gold has value these days, just because it can be used to back the money. Ether dollar is a project to implement a decentralized money on top of  Ether as gold of Ethereum territory.

Although there are many important things that make Ether dollar different from other efforts in this space, like being more reliable against governments’ attack or being independent from governments’ issued money; the most important thing that makes it different is its reliance on Cryptocongress.

When Satoshi was designing gold of this new freedomland, he didn’t know that ASIC manufacturers would win all the tens of billions of dollar gold being mined in this territory! We gave up gold to ASIC manufacturers. But don’t worry! It was just gold. There is still a much bigger market untouched! Money market is at least 10 times bigger than gold market.

Cryptocongress is an effort to direct the benefits of this new freedomland money market to entrepreneurs who discovered this territory and will develop it in the future, instead of ASIC manufacturers.

[This is](https://github.com/cryptocongress/members/blob/master/members.csv) an initial list of these entrepreneurs who are qualified to join Cryptocongress.
